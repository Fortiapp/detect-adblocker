# detect-adblocker
You can use this to detect if the ad blocker is enabled on the visitor browser. See the result in action on the [Example][3] page.

## Installation

Using this tool is very simple.
First you need to create a file and put the following in this file:

    (function (i, o, g) {
        i[o] = g;
    })(window, 'adblocker', false);

Now save the file with a name `ads.js` and upload it to a known location on your server.

 finally you only need to place the following before any script tag in your web page as the following:


    <!--adBlocker detection code - START-->
    <script src="path/to/your/ads.js"></script>
    <script>
        (function (i, o, g, r) {
            i[o] = (typeof i[o] == typeof undefined) ? g : r
        })(window, 'adblocker', true, false);
    </script>
    <!--adBlocker detection code - END-->

## Usage

Now you only need to check for adblocker variable in your code

    if (adblocker) {
        // the add blocker is enabled
    }else{
        // ad blocker is not enabled
    }
